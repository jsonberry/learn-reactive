This 64 page academic paper dives deep into the details of software engineering complexity and proposes that a way to simplify development is through functional reactive programming. From the abstract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Complexity is the single major difficulty in the successful development of large scale software systems. Following Brooks we distinguish accidental from essential difficulty, but disagree with his premise that most complexity remaining in contemporary systems is essential. We identify common causes of complexity and discuss general approaches which can be taken to eliminate them where they are accidental in nature. To make things more concrete we then give an outline fora potential complexity-minimizing approach based on functional programming and Codd’s relational model of data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With some FRP/RxJS/Redux fundamentals under your belt, reading this paper could ignite your imagination for how to apply these techniques at large and see the light at the end of the complexity tunnel.</p>\n"},"rxjs-in-depth-promises-vs-observables-and-much-more":{"id":"rxjs-in-depth-promises-vs-observables-and-much-more","title":"RxJS In-Depth: Promises vs. Observables and Much More","author":"Ben Lesh","tags":["RxJS"],"cost":false,"difficulty":"beginner","format":"video","content":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KOOT7BArVHQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>Recorded in 2015 at AngularConnect, Ben Lesh goes through a beginner talk on RxJS. This talk is focused on beginning concepts with Observables and RxJS rather than broader reactive concepts. It’s full of concepts and examples. Some of the topics that Ben digs into are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promises vs. Observables</li>\n<li>What the heck are Observable streams?</li>\n<li>Breakdown of what RxJS operators are all about</li>\n<li>Hot vs. Cold Observables</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end there is a multiplexed WebSocket stock ticker example that’s well worth checking out. This can help show some of the power behind Rx outside of handling mouse clicks and XHR requests.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: Some of the RxJS syntax is outdated, see the <a href=\"https://rxjs.dev/guide/v6/pipeable-operators\" target=\"_blank\">pipeable operators</a> doc for updates</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},"the-introduction-to-reactive-programming-youve-been-missing":{"id":"the-introduction-to-reactive-programming-youve-been-missing","title":"The Introduction to Reactive Programming You've Been Missing","author":"André Staltz","tags":["FRP","Reactive Programming","RxJS"],"cost":false,"difficulty":"beginner","format":"article","bestOf":true,"origin_title":"The Introduction to Reactive Programming You've Been Missing","source":"https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754","content":"<p>Written in 2014 by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrestaltz\" target=\"_blank\">André Staltz</a>, an alumni of RxJS development and the creator of a multitude of reactive tools including <a href=\"https://cycle.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycle.js</a>.
