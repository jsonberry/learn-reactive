[Thomas Burleson](https://twitter.com/ThomasBurleson) does a comprehensive write-up of defining reactive push based architectures. The concepts discussed are very much framework and library agnostic and touch upon the nature of reactive programming.

> This approach to using permanent streams to push-data is a fundamental, HUGE paradigm shift from traditional pull-based architectures.

In this post Thomas uses [Angular](https://angular.io), [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to help explain the implementation details of the architecture. This post will be easier to understand if you have basic knowledge of those technologies.
