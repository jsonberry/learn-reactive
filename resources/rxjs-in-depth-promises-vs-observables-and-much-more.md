Recorded in 2015 at AngularConnect, Ben Lesh goes through a beginner talk on RxJS. This talk is focused on beginning concepts with Observables and RxJS rather than broader reactive concepts. It’s full of concepts and examples. Some of the topics that Ben digs into are: 

- Promises vs. Observables
- What the heck are Observable streams?
- Breakdown of what RxJS operators are all about
- Hot vs. Cold Observables

At the end there is a multiplexed WebSocket stock ticker example that’s well worth checking out. This can help show some of the power behind Rx outside of handling mouse clicks and XHR requests.
