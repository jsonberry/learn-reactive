[Marcus Rådell](https://twitter.com/marcusradell) is a fullstack JavaScript enthusiast that has been a huge fan of reactive programming for more than three years. His specialty has been to write state management frontend code for React based on RxJS Subjects.

> A Finite-state Machine (FSM) is a technique for managing the state of an application that distinctly defines available states and the transitions between states in response to external inputs and/or a condition is satisifed.

In this example Marcus creates a reactive FSM using RxJS. He also extracted the work out into a library for use with React via [RxMachine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rx-machine).
