[Sergi Mansilla](https://twitter.com/sergimansilla), author of [Reactive Programming with RxJS](https://pragprog.com/book/smreactjs/reactive-programming-with-rxjs), presents at the 2014 [GOTO](https://blog.gotocon.com/) conference. This is a practical introduction to functional reactive programming where Sergi connects the micromanagement of event handling and state management using imperative approaches to a declarative and reactive approach. He also connects the challenge of asynchronous programming in JavaScript and how it can be made easier with RxJS. Even though RxJS used as a framework for learning in this talk the fundamentals discussed are framework agnostic.

> Note: Some of the RxJS syntax is outdated, but the updates you’d have to make for current versions is not drastic, mostly you’d just have move to [pipeable operators](https://rxjs.dev/guide/v6/pipeable-operators) instead of using the dot chaining methods. The fundamentals that are taught do not change, only a few syntax things here and there.
