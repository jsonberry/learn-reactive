> This talk covers reactive fundamentals and is easier to consume if you have a basic understanding of Observables, types, and functional programming.

This is a delightful talk from one of the primary proponents for reactive programming, [Erik Meijer](https://twitter.com/headinthebox). He dives into moving from imperative non-reactive programming to declarative reactive programming and how it helps us deal with side effects in our applications.

Erik is a verbose and entertaining speaker. This talk is a bit on the academic side of what reactive programming is about but he gives concrete examples of what it means to move toward reactive programming by breaking down the intentions and behavior of Observables and the composition of handling side effects.
