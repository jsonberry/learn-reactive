[Victor Savkin](https://twitter.com/victorsavkin), a former Googler that worked on a large part of the Angular framework and one of the founders of [Nrwl](https://nrwl.io/), synthesizes [Martin Fowler's](https://twitter.com/martinfowler) work in [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://www.martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html) into a relatable and digestable framework for understanding modern state management.

> From Jason: When we're using RP and FRP we're employing particular techniques to managing state, and this article showcases a specific implementation via Angular and NgRx while touching on some strong fundamentals of generic state management in web applications.
