Presented at [Angular Cruise](https://ngcruise.com/#/) in 2017, [Ben Lesh](https://twitter.com/BenLesh) showcases an example of RxJS usage that composes user interaction, animation, AJAX and cancellation.

> Note: Some of the RxJS syntax is outdated, but the updates you’d have to make for current versions is not drastic, mostly you’d just have move to [pipeable operators](https://rxjs.dev/guide/v6/pipeable-operators) instead of using the dot chaining methods. The fundamentals that are taught do not change, only a few syntax things here and there. Also note that the **do** operator was replaced by the [tap](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/tap) operator.
