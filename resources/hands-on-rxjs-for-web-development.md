> Harness the power of RxJS by solving real-life web tasks with Reactive programming; use Observables to code less.

A good RxJS starter video course with clear explanations from [Oleksandr Poshtaruk](https://twitter.com/El_Extremal). Oriented on total RxJS beginners but contains advanced level stuff as well. Oleksandr is highly involved in the RxJS and reactive community and he [writes extensively about it on Medium](https://medium.com/@alexanderposhtaruk).
