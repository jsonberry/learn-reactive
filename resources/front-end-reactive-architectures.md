From [Luca Mezzalira](https://twitter.com/lucamezzalira), learn how to use reactive architectures on the front-end. There are many technologies using a reactive approach on the back end, but this book teaches you how the reactive manifesto can be used to benefit your front-end programming as well.

You will discover what reactive programming is, what the current front-end ecosystem looks like, and how to use a range of frameworks and libraries. You will also apply specific reactive architectures in your own projects. Each concept is taught with a mix of technical explanations and real-world code implementations. 

The future of front-end programming and architecture is reactive – don’t get left behind: Add Front-End Reactive Architectures to your library today. 

### What You'll Learn

- Understand when and why you should use a reactive architecture
- Apply a specific reactive architecture in a project
- Manage different reactive architectures

### Who This Book Is For
Mid-senior front-end developers, tech leads, and solutions architects

> This book looks so good, especially for beginners that aren't having too much trouble wrapping their head around reactive concepts. I have not read it yet so I didn't mark it as a best of resource, but it looks like it could be one of the better ones.
