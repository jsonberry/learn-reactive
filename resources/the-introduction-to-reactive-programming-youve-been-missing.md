Written in 2014 by [https://twitter.com/andrestaltz](André Staltz), an alumni of RxJS development and the creator of a multitude of reactive tools including [https://cycle.js.org/](Cycle.js). With 17k+ stars on GitHub since it surfaced, this post is hands down one of the best introductions to reactive programming that you can find. He uses RxJS as a means to communicate, but this intro goes beyond RxJS and encompasses reactive thinking in general. Start here!

> Note: Some of the RxJS syntax is outdated, but the updates you’d have to make for current versions is not drastic, mostly you’d just have move to [https://rxjs.dev/guide/v6/pipeable-operators](pipeable operators) instead of using the dot chaining methods. The fundamentals that are taught do not change, only a few syntax things here and there. Also note the flatmap operator is now just an alias for the preferred operator [https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/mergeMap](mergeMap).
