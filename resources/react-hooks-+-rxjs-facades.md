[Thomas Burleson](https://twitter.com/ThomasBurleson) first gave us a look at [push based architectures](https://medium.com/@thomasburlesonIA/push-based-architectures-with-rxjs-81b327d7c32d) with using [Angular](https://angular.io) as a framework for understanding the implementation details.

Now Thomas revisits the topic of reactive push-based architectures and uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the new [Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to introduce the same concepts. He also gives examples of using [Akita](https://netbasal.gitbook.io/akita/), a framework agnostic JavaScript library for simplifying state management through Observable streams.
