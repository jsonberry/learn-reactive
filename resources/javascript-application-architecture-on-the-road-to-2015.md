[Addy Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani), a very active member of the web development community and currently (2019) working on Google Chrome, summarizes the state of JavaScript application architecture as we were heading into 2015. 

> I thought it might be salutary to look at the state of application architecture in the JavaScript community as we ebb our way towards 2015. Iâ€™ll talk about composition, functional boundaries, modularity, immutable data structures, CSP channels and a few other related topics

In particular, check out the section where he discusses Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) and how it relates to FRP and JavaScript application architecture as we see it today, going into 2020.
