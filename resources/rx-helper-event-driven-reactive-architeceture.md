[Dean Radcliffe](https://twitter.com/deaniusol) brings us [Rx-Helper](https://github.com/deanius/rx-helper), an API that lets you, <i>"...use events to drive state management, UI updates, etc in a decoupled, event-driven architecture."</i>

Dean is combing his learning from the Rx community and other great sources like [Martin Fowler](https://twitter.com/martinfowler) and [Bob Martin](https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin) to deliver this tool that helps you build reactive software.

> From Jason: This sort of endeavor is big, and I think it's a great step toward good solutions for writing reactive applications especially considering doing fullstack TypeScript development. I applaud Dean's work and look forward to watching it grow!
