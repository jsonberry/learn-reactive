The 2006 seminal writing from Ben Moseley and Peter Marks. This 64 page academic paper dives deep into the details of software engineering complexity and proposes that a way to simplify development is through functional reactive programming. From the abstract:

> "Complexity is the single major difficulty in the successful development of large scale software systems. Following Brooks we distinguish accidental from essential difficulty, but disagree with his premise that most complexity remaining in contemporary systems is essential. We identify common causes of complexity and discuss general approaches which can be taken to eliminate them where they are accidental in nature. To make things more concrete we then give an outline fora potential complexity-minimizing approach based on functional programming and Coddâ€™s relational model of data."

With some FRP/RxJS/Redux fundamentals under your belt, reading this paper could ignite your imagination for how to apply these techniques at large and see the light at the end of the complexity tunnel.
